Label Widget


The Label widget is a fundamental widget used to display text or images. It provides a simple way to show static text or an image on a tkinter window or frame.

To create a Label widget in tkinter, you typically use the Label class and pass the parent widget (e.g., the root window or a frame) as the first parameter, along with other optional parameters to customize the label's appearance.

The Label widget supports various options to customize its appearance, such as font, bg (background color), fg (foreground/text color), width, height, anchor (alignment within the available space), and more. You can specify these options as keyword arguments when creating the Label widget.
