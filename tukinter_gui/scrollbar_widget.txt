Scrollbar widget

Tkinter Scrollbar widget is a graphical control element that provides a scrolling mechanism for other widgets with limited visible space, such as Listbox, Text, or Canvas. It allows the user to scroll through the content that exceeds the available area.

The Scrollbar widget in Tkinter is typically used in combination with another widget or a container that supports scrolling. It provides a vertical or horizontal scroll bar, or both, depending on the orientation specified.
