Canvas widget

A canvas is a versatile widget that allows drawing graphics, shapes, and images. It provides a blank space where you can place and manipulate various graphical elements.

To create a Canvas widget in tkinter, you typically use the Canvas class and pass the parent widget (e.g., the root window or a frame) as the first parameter, along with other optional parameters to customize the canvas's appearance and behavior.

The Canvas widget provides a variety of methods to create and manipulate graphics, such as lines, rectangles, ovals, polygons, text, and images. You can customize the appearance of the graphics by specifying parameters like color, width, fill, outline, and more. You can also bind events to the canvas to make it interactive, such as responding to mouse clicks or keyboard events.
