Listbox widget

The Listbox widget in Tkinter provides a list-like interface where you can display a collection of items. It allows the user to select one or more items from the list. The Listbox can be populated with items using the `insert()` method, and you can retrieve the selected item(s) using methods such as `curselection()` or `get()`. You can configure attributes like width, height, font, and scrollbar for the Listbox widget.
