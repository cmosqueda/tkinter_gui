Place Geometry Manager:

The place geometry manager is one of the three layout managers available for organizing and positioning widgets within a window or frame. The place manager allows you to specify the exact position and size of a widget by using absolute coordinates.

To use the place geometry manager in tkinter, you typically call the place() method on the widget you want to position, specifying the x and y coordinates, along with other optional parameters.

The place() method provides additional optional parameters to control the size and behavior of the widget, such as width, height, anchor, relx, rely, relwidth, relheight, and more. These parameters can be passed as keyword arguments to the place() method to achieve different placement configurations.
