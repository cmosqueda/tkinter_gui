Grid Geometry Manager:

The grid geometry manager is one of the three layout managers available for organizing and positioning widgets within a window or frame. The grid manager allows you to create a grid-like structure of rows and columns and place widgets at specific positions within that grid.

To use the grid geometry manager in tkinter, you typically call the grid() method on the widget you want to place, specifying the row and column indices along with other optional parameters.

The grid() method provides additional optional parameters that allow you to control how widgets are placed within the grid, such as columnspan, rowspan, sticky, padx, pady, and more. These parameters can be passed as keyword arguments to the grid() method to achieve different positioning configurations.
