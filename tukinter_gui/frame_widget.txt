Frame widget

Frames are container widgets used to organize and group other GUI elements together. They provide a way to structure the layout of an application and manage the placement of components within it.

To create a Frame widget in tkinter, you typically use the Frame class and pass the parent widget (e.g., the root window or another frame) as the first parameter, along with other optional parameters to customize the frame's appearance and behavior.

The Frame widget can be customized with various options and parameters. Some common options include bg (background color), bd (border width), relief (border style), width, height, and more. You can specify these options as keyword arguments when creating the Frame widget.
